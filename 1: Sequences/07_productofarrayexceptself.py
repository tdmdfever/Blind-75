"""
Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element at index 
i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array 
except the one at i. You must solve this problem without using division.

Examples
Input: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected Output: [60, 40, 30, 24]
Justification: For the first element: 3*4*5 = 60, for the second 
element: 2*4*5 = 40, for the third element: 2*3*5 = 30, and for the 
fourth element: 2*3*4 = 24.
Input: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Justification: Every element is 1, so the product of all other numbers 
for each index is also 1.
Input: [10, 20, 30, 40]
Expected Output: [24000, 12000, 8000, 6000]
Justification: For the first element: 20*30*40 = 24000, for the second 
element: 10*30*40 = 12000, for the third element: 10*20*40 = 8000, 
and for the fourth element: 10*20*30 = 6000.
