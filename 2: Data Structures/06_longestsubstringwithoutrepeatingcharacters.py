"""
Given a string s, return the maximum number of unique substrings that the 
given string can be split into.

You can split string s into any list of non-empty substrings, where the 
concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must 
split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aab"  
Output: 2  
Explanation: Two possible ways to split the given string into 
maximum unique substrings are: ['a', 'ab'] & ['aa', 'b'], 
both have 2 substrings; hence the maximum number of unique substrings 
in which the given string can be split is 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcabc"  
Output: 4  
Explanation: Four possible ways to split into maximum unique 
substrings are: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'abc'] & ['a', 'b', 'cab', 'c'] &  
['a', 'bca', 'b', 'c'] & ['abc', 'a', 'b', 'c'], all have 4 
substrings.
