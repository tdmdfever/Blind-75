"""
Given an m x n grid of characters 'board' and a list of strings 'words',
return all words from the list that can be constructed from letters of
sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or
vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than
once in a single word.

Example 1:
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],
                 ["e","t","a","e"],
                 ["i","h","k","r"],
                 ["i","f","l","v"]]
       words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]

Example 2:
Input: board = [["a","b"],
                 ["c","d"]]
       words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
